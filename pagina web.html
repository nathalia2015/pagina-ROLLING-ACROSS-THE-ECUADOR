<h2>The personality of a tourist in a hotel</h2>
<p>
<b>W</b>elcome to the hilton colon hotel, it is a pleasure to have you here, I hope you like any need or concern, 
we are here to serve you. I just arrived from Galapagos two days ago for the chess competition, my reception 
is on the fourth floor. I just met my roommates. I have three roommates. Jose is from Ambato; it is tall and heavy;
 he has hazel eyes. He is friendly and outgoing. Maria is beautiful; she is from the Verde province she is quite good.
 You seem to have a strong personality; I think we'll get along fine. Felipe comes from chimborazo. He is short, slim,
 and athletic. He loves sports, especially tennis. He's reserved so he doesn't talk much.
I am very excited because tomorrow we are going to the museum of the city of Quito.

<h2>The art in Ecuador</h2>
<p>
  <b>I</b>n Ecuador art has always been present, whether in architecture, painting, theater, dance, photography.
We Ecuadorians live surrounded by art which has created that we do not appreciate itas we should because 
we are used to it. The main characteristics of the Quiteña school is that it adds mestizo color to the skin of the
 portrayed, which used to be white in accordance with the color.The festival of light is celebrated as a tribute to 
the month of the arts, it is considered as a technological and artistic expirementation space for the local area,
 the party is an amazing show that makes people take public spaces and relates to art.
